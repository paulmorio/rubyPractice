## This document serves as a review of all the exercises done so far ##

- puts: prints a string argument and places a newline
- the octothorpe allows for singleline commenting
- mathematical operations just prints on the screen
- using #{} in strings allows to do string formatting
- of course the well known "%d %s %f" % [list of variables] still works in ruby
- strings can be concatenated with the + sign
- print, does what it says it does and prints a string (or anything that has a toString function), but unlike puts, does not place a newline at the end.
- look at ex8, it shows some of the possibilities one can have with string formatting.
- doing {{{puts "", variable}}} allows you to print the variable on the next line. its like saying put this and also put this. The "," gets dropped.
- \ is the escape key, \t tabs our stuff
- one can also create a longer formatted string via this method: 
  {{{fat_cat = <<MY_HEREDOC
	 I'll do a list:
	 \t* Cat food
	 \t* Fishies
	 \t* Catnip\n\t* Grass
	 MY_HEREDOC
  }}}
- gets.chomp() awaits input, can be used for interactivity or for reading in of input from files.
- look at ex12 for library explanations.
- ARGV (argument vector?) are the argrments that are supplied with the calling of the ruby program
  - you can use then like this {{{first, second, third, = ARGV}}}
  - $0 is a special argument vector that points to the program (or rather sourcefile) itself
  - ex14 is a good example showing off the usage of argvs and the stdin.
- open(filename) does not retrn the contents of a file but rather makes it into "File Object" that we can pass more methods to. Some commands one can use iwth the file object are listed below:
  - close: closes the file. Like File -> Save in a text editor.
  - read: reads the contents of the file. one can assign the result to a variable
  - readline: reads just one line of the text file.
  - truncate: empties the file
  - write("STUFF"): Writes "STUFF" into the file.
- Always remember to close the files you were using when done using them.
- different ARGVs can be accessed using ARGV.first, etc.
- $stdin.gets, just waits for any key.
- ex16 shows an example of making a simple text editor for three lines, clearly this is just a toy example however.
- fileObject.length tells you the number of bytes in the file (can be used to represent the number of characters inside a text file.)
- ex17 is an example of copying one text file to another.
- we can supply an arbitrary number of parameters to a function if we supply args* into the paramenter field.
  - functions are defined very similarly to python,
  - the end of a function is specified with the word "end"
  - operations and variables can be used in the parameter fields of funtions that have been defined.
  - look at ex20 for some interesting usage of reading and outputting the contents of a text file.
  - ex21 looks at defining Mathematical functions and using them as parameters in functions, therefore it is easily possible to program complex functions using more functions, or making particularly complex commands. Look at the final example in ex21 for such an instance.
