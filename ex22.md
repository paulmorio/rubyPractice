## This document serves as a review of all the exercises done so far ##

- puts: prints a string argument and places a newline
- the octothorpe allows for singleline commenting
- mathematical operations just prints on the screen
- using #{} in strings allows to do string formatting
- of course the well known "%d %s %f" % [list of variables] still works in ruby
- strings can be concatenated with the + sign
- print, does what it says it does and prints a string (or anything that has a toString function), but unlike puts, does not place a newline at the end.
- look at ex8, it shows some of the possibilities one can have with string formatting.
- doing {{{puts "", variable}}} allows you to print the variable on the next line. its like saying put this and also put this. The "," gets dropped.
- \ is the escape key, \t tabs our stuff
- one can also create a longer formatted string via this method: 
  {{{fat_cat = <<MY_HEREDOC
	 I'll do a list:
	 \t* Cat food
	 \t* Fishies
	 \t* Catnip\n\t* Grass
	 MY_HEREDOC
  }}}
- gets.chomp() awaits input, can be used for interactivity or for reading in of input from files.
- look at ex12 for library explanations.
- ARGV (argument vector?) are the argrments that are supplied with the calling of the ruby program
  - you can use then like this {{{first, second, third, = ARGV}}}
  - $0 is a special argument vector that points to the program (or rather sourcefile) itself
  - ex14 is a good example showing off the usage of argvs and the stdin.
- open(filename) does not retrn the contents of a file but rather makes it into "File Object" that we can pass more methods to. Some commands one can use iwth the file object are listed below:
  - close: closes the file. Like File -> Save in a text editor.
  - read: reads the contents of the file. one can assign the result to a variable
  - readline: reads just one line of the text file.
  - truncate: empties the file
  - write("STUFF"): Writes "STUFF" into the file.
- Always remember to close the files you were using when done using them.
